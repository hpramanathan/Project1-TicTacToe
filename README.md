# PROJECT 1: TIC TAC TOE

## DESCRIPTION
- This is a game of tic tac toe that can be played between 2 human players.
- This game was the first of four projects as part of a Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.
- We were assigned the project in the 3rd week having learnt some fundamental Git, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## DEPLOYMENT LINK
- You can access the game here: [Tic Tac Toe by Hari R](https://hpramanathan.github.io/Project1-TicTacToe/)


## GETTING STARTED/CODE INSTALLATION
- The user just needs to load the deployment link above to play the game.


## TIMEFRAME & WORKING TEAM (SOLO)
- We were given 5.5 days to work on this project on our own.


## TECHNOLOGIES USED
- CODE VERSIONING/CONTROL
  - Git and GitHub
- DEVELOPER TOOLS
  - Windows Subsystem for Linux, Visual Studio Code, Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Firefox Developer Tools
- WIREFRAME
  - Figma


## PLANNING
- I used Figma to create a basic wireframe of the game console on the webpage.

## BUILD/CODE PROCESS
- When the page loads everything appears.
- Player 1 always goes first.
- Player 1 clicks on any square and it's filled with an X.
- Then Player 2 clicks on any other square and it's filled with an O and they keep taking alternate turns.
- Neither player can click on a square that's already been filled in.
- If either player gets 3 of their symbols in a row (by column, row or diagonally) a winner will be declared.
- Otherwise once all the squares have been filled in, a tie will be declared.
- When you press the Restart Game button the game resets and you can play again.
