PSEUDOCODE
- When the page loads everything appears.
- After a 0.5s delay a pop-up laid over the main square asks if Player 1 wants 
  to play against Player 2 or the Computer.
- If Player 1 chooses Player 2 then the pop-up goes away and Player 1 has the 
  first go.
- They each take turns either until someone wins or there's no winner.
