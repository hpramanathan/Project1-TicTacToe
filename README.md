## DESCRIPTION
- This is a game of tic tac toe that can be played between 2 human players.

## PSEUDOCODE
- When the page loads everything appears.
- Player 1 always goes first.
- Player 1 clicks on any square and it's filled with an X.
- Then Player 2 clicks on any other square and it's filled with an O and they keep taking alternate turns.
- Neither player can click on a square that's already been filled in.
- If either player gets 3 of their symbols in a row (by column, row or diagonally) a winner will be declared.
- Otherwise once all the squares have been filled in, a tie will be declared.
- When you press the Restart Game button the game resets and you can play again.
